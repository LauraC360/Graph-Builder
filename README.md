# Graph Builder
App for handling function graphs and different relevant points/lines associated with their respective graphs. Made in C++ only, just using the WinBGIm Graphics Library (https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~main/bgi/doc/)  for interface.

### Specifications
The project was made for a faculty course and it was very challenging because it was made with the help of the original proposed graphics library for interface. But, still, the interface works well and with some tweaks that were made it almost looks like an actual modern interface.

The app is meant to be used only in the way shown in Help (or "Ajutor" in the Romanian language mode of the app). It is quite simple to use: Just write the function and an "a" and then a "b" variable will appear. These are the initial limits for the function graph displayed. But then, it switches to another window with the main app: there you can use the zoom in, out, shift buttons to change the view for the function graph, can add multiple type of special points on the graph, and even some lines representing, for example, the asymptotes of the function. Even tho the load time is slow for too many calculations because they were did by aproximating some values and actually computing the functions for large inputs, it works pretty well.

### ERRORS
They may be some errors, especially when all of the data for a function is hard to calculate or when the amount of "zoom-out" is too much to handle for the function computing module.
